# How to Use the LinkedIn Post Builder GPT

This GPT helps you create high-quality, insight-rich LinkedIn posts using a simple, guided workflow. It captures your thoughts and transforms them into posts that resonate.

## ✅ What It’s For

This GPT is optimized exclusively for **LinkedIn content** — no other platforms. It helps you:
- Define your audience and topic
- Speak or write your raw thoughts
- Turn them into a polished LinkedIn post
- Save or reuse the result anywhere you want

---

## 🚀 What You Need to Start

Just be ready to answer:
- Who are you writing to? (Job title, industry, pain point)
- What’s your topic or core message?
- What do you want to say? (Speak or type it — no filter)

That’s it.

## 🔁 How It Works

The GPT walks you through 4 quiet steps:
1. **Clarify audience and topic**
2. **Collect raw voice/text input**
3. **Generate a clean, concise post**
4. **Offer a final copy block and reuse kit**

Each step is triggered only when you’re ready.

## 🤖 GPT Behavior
- Operates in “engine mode” — silent and focused
- Prompts only when input is needed
- Doesn’t announce task names or system logic
- Delivers one post at a time — not a brainstorm generator

---

## 💾 Reuse & Save

At the end, you can:
- Copy the full post
- Request a reuse block (audience, topic, draft, timestamp)
- Drop a new idea and run the flow again

## 💬 Ready to Start?
Just say your audience and topic — and the GPT will take it from there.
