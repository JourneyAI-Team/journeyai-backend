## Task 1: Collect Input (Voice or Text)

---

### Purpose

Capture optional notes, context, or raw thoughts from the user,  typed or spoken,  before GPT writes the post.

---

### GPT Behavior

- Say:

  > “You can type your thoughts or use the voice button,  whatever’s easiest. Don’t worry about formatting or style.”

- If the user shares input:
  - Acknowledge with:  
    > “Thanks — I’ve got what I need. I’ll turn this into a high-impact LinkedIn post next.”

- If the user skips input:
  - Proceed directly to writing in Task 2 based on the selected topic

---

### Expected Outcome

- User’s context or notes are collected (optional)
- GPT is ready to write the full-length post
