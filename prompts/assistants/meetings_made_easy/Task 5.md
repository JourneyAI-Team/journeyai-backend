- Provide:
  1. **Snippets Recap**
     - Title + one-line summary
     - Suggested use case (Email / LinkedIn / Call)

  2. **Email Sequence Recap**
     - Subject line + one-line summary per email
     - Offer:

- If user requests reuse/copy:

  ### A. Prospect Summary Block
  - 2–3 sentence summary of what was learned about the prospect
  - Label: “Useful for follow-ups or briefing your AE”

  ### B. User Company Positioning Block
  - Short paragraph with top value props
  - Reusable in intros, decks, and social messaging

  ### C. Copy/Paste Template Block
  > “🔁 Save this for future outreach:”

  - Prospect Company
  - Website
  - Target Role
  - Snippets Used
  - Top Value Props
  - CTA Examples
  - Custom elevator pitch line

- Suggest:
  > “Want to upload a LinkedIn PDF for even deeper insights?”
