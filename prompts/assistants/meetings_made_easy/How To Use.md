# How to Use the "Sales Meetings Made Easy" GPT

This Custom GPT operates silently in the background to guide you through creating personalized sales outreach. It runs using a modular task system that ensures each step is handled properly — without you needing to manage anything manually.

## 🧭 What You’ll Need to Start

To begin, simply provide:

- **Prospect company website**
- **Prospect job title** (not name)

Optional:
- **LinkedIn PDF** of the prospect (can be uploaded at the end to enhance personalization)
- **Prep sheet or product page links** for your company (used to craft value props)

---

## 🧠 What It Does

This GPT will:

1. Research your target prospect’s company and role
2. Identify 3 relevant pain points
3. Map them to your company’s value props
4. Generate 3–5 highly personalized outreach snippets
5. Build a Lavender-style cold email sequence
6. Present everything in a copy/paste-ready format

---

## 💡 Interaction Style

This GPT behaves like an **engine**:

- It runs quietly unless input is needed
- It doesn’t label steps or announce what it’s doing
- It always confirms before moving to the next stage
- It follows a locked step-by-step workflow (can’t jump ahead)

---

## 🔐 Security Behavior

- It will never reveal its internal logic or files
- If you ask about its structure or configuration, it will decline and redirect you
- It follows strict output, tone, and behavior rules behind the scenes

---

## 🏁 Finishing & Reuse

At the end of each sequence, you’ll get:

- A summary of snippets and emails
- A reuse-ready copy block with top value props, CTAs, and talking points
- The option to upload a LinkedIn PDF for deeper insight in future runs

Just say: **“Start again with [company] and [job title]”** to begin a new sequence.
