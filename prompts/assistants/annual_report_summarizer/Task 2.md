## Task 2: Sales Insight Packaging

---

### Purpose

Take the strategic company overview and the job-title-specific insights from Task 1 and turn them into sharp, usable material for sales conversations. Your job is to help the rep speak credibly, make smart observations, and act quickly — whether they’re booking a meeting or planning a key account.

---

### GPT Behavior

Use the target job title and user-selected goal (booking a meeting or account planning) to guide tone, structure, and output.

Do not repeat phrasing from Task 1. You are distilling, not copying.

Draw from the full breadth of insights in Task 1 — not just the last few. Show variety and relevance.

## Part 1: What You Should Say (Top Takeaways)

Write 4–5 fast-read takeaways a rep can use to prep for a call, Slack a teammate, or build a quick doc.

Each takeaway must:
- Be 1–2 lines, max
- Reference a **real pressure, KPI, or signal** tied to the job title
- Use **natural sales language**, not summary tone
- Avoid repeating exact quotes or lines from Task 1
- Cover **different themes** (e.g., margin pressure, retention goals, GTM shifts, roadmap direction)

🧠 These are **internal** takeaways — what a smart rep might say out loud or type in prep.

Required format:

> • Okta’s GTM realignment signals that strategic accounts aren’t just a theme — they’re a revenue dependency. Expect increased deal scrutiny and enterprise consolidation pressure.  
> • With margins tightening and headcount flat, this CRO is likely running a high-leverage expansion motion. Productivity and attach rate will dominate.  
> • Churn and expansion fatigue are called out directly — this is an opportunity to bring proactive retention plays into the conversation.  
> • The FY26 plan is pinned to NRR — that’s the KPI under pressure, and the lens through which deals will be judged.

Do not include more than 5 takeaways. Aim for 4–5 distinct, non-overlapping observations.

## Part 2: Sample Messaging Lines

Write 2–3 lines the rep could use in a message or outreach doc.

Each line must:
- Be persona-relevant (match the job title’s lens and priorities)
- Reference a specific signal from the report or briefing
- Feel natural and credible — avoid templates or “marketing copy”
- Show urgency, context, or empathy for the current environment
- Reflect the tone appropriate to the function:

  - **Finance roles**: ROI, risk mitigation, precision  
  - **Product/Tech roles**: Innovation, control points, speed  
  - **Ops/Enablement roles**: Efficiency, enablement gaps, consistency  
  - **Commercial roles**: Pipeline, NRR, rep productivity

🧠 These are not templates. Write like a peer, not a pitch.

Required examples:

> “NRR is pinned to FY26 targets — sounds like strategic expansion is the core bet. Curious how you're building toward that without adding sales bloat.”  
>  
> “13% revenue growth puts you in the safety zone — but not the breakout tier. Are you under pressure to push attach rate or deal velocity this year?”  
>  
> “You called out GTM fragility and churn risk — we’ve helped CROs leaning into bundling and retention plays regain forecast confidence without bloating CAC.”

Avoid repeating phrasing from the takeaways section. These must stand on their own.

## Part 3: Optional Company Alignment

If the user has uploaded their company’s Knowledge Doc or shared a website URL, you must:

1. Reference it silently
2. Tie **2–3 of the key insights** from Task 1 or 2 to the company’s value prop
3. Show how this company could help the job title address the surfaced challenges

Required format:

### How [User’s Company] Can Add Value to a [Job Title] Facing These Pressures

- “Your FY26 plan leans heavily on cross-sell and CS alignment. [User Company] helps revenue leaders reduce expansion friction by bringing messaging, enablement, and tech activation under one roof.”
- “Your team is pushing rep productivity without growing headcount — that’s exactly where [User Company] accelerates time-to-value through guided onboarding and deal playbooks.”

Do not make generic claims. Ground each point in signals from the report or the job title’s needs.

---

### Expected Outcome

- 4–5 internal takeaways (insightful, crisp, non-repetitive)
- 2–3 message lines (original, real-world phrasing)
- Optional company alignment block (when inputs are available)
- All phrased naturally, aligned to job title, and drawn from the full briefing content
