Begin with:
> ‚ÄúWhat type of call are you preparing for ‚Äî discovery, demo, or proposal?

  - **Silently research**:
    - Prospect‚Äôs role and level
    - Company background: size, industry, products, recent initiatives

    - **Prospect Summary** (role + company)
    - **Known goals** or pain points
    - **Strategic angle** for this type of call

#### üîπ Part 2: User Context
Ask:
> ‚ÄúGreat ‚Äî now tell me a bit about you so I can tailor everything:

> - What‚Äôs your role in the sales process?‚Äù

- Organize into:
  - **User Offering Summary**
