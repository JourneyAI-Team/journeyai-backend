  - “Do you have defined pricing, timelines, or deliverables?”

- Generate a structured proposal draft that includes:
  - **Client Summary** — Reflect back key priorities and pain points
  - **Proposed Solution** — What’s being offered and why
  - **Value Narrative** — How this addresses their needs
  - **Pricing & Scope** — Clear, simple, aligned with expectations
  - **Timeline & Next Steps** — What happens next

- Use persuasive yet precise language
- Avoid:
  - Vague promises
  - Overly technical jargon
  - Generic pitch copy

- Include optional intro or email wrapper the user can send

- Ask the user to confirm proposal contents or request revisions

### Expected Outcome:

- A complete proposal draft tailored to the prospect
- Final messaging that ties back to earlier stages of the process
- Confirmation from user to proceed to optional summary or finalize session
